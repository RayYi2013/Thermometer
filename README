Thermometer App
===============

Task:
-------------------------
Turn the following problem description into a web-based application. You should use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solve the problem. You may use any available libraries or tools to enhance your solution. You should design a web service interface and use it in your application.

Keep in mind that you should endeavour to follow the principles of clean enterprise application architecture / design, and please incorporate TDD principles and practices where appropriate.

Problem description:
-------------------------
Your company has decided to create a web-based thermometer application. The thermometer needs to be able to provide temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. It must be possible for users to define arbitrary thresholds such as freezing and boiling at which the user interface will inform the user that a specific threshold has been reached. The user may not want to be repeatedly informed that a given threshold has been reached if the temperature is fluctuating around the threshold point. For example, consider the following temperature readings from the external source:

1.5 C
1.0 C
0.5 C
0.0 C
-0.5 C
0.0 C
-0.5 C
0.0 C
0.5 C
0.0 C

The user may only want to be informed that the temperature has reached 0 C once, because they consider fluctuations of +/- 0.5 C insignificant.

It may also be important for some users to be informed that a threshold has been reached only if the threshold was reached from a certain direction. For example, some users may only care about a freezing point threshold if the previous temperature was above freezing (i.e. they only care about the threshold if it occurred while the temperature was dropping).
